## Description
I am building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation
Expand the TooClose folder, right click on the root directory, and select "Open in Integrated Terminal". In the terminal, type "npm install" and press Enter. After the dependencies right-clicks are installed, close the terminal. Right-click on the src folder and select open in integrated terminal. Type "npm run build." This function will create a dist folder, after you see the dist folder, you can close the terminal. Then right-click on the server folder and select open in the integrated terminal. Type "npm run start", this command will launch your application on port 30001. Open your web browser, type localhost:3001. Then you should see an install button, click on it and click OK at the prompt. Have fun taking notes!

## Usage
You can either taking note on the web browswer or install the application and taking notes that way. Taking notes through the web browser is not risky because if the caches empty, your notes will be deleted  as well.
